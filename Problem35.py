# Circular primes
# Problem 35

# The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits:
#                  197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

# There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

# How many circular primes are there below one million?

# Solution 2

# While researching circular primes (not to be confused with permutable primes)
# it became clear that the only interesting ones are below one million. 
# After one million the only circular primes are repunits.

# Repunits are numbers composed of only 1s, and is described as R5 = 11111.
# Some of these circular-repunit primes include R19, R23, R317, R1031, R49081, and on from there.

# To solve this problem we generate a set of 78,498 prime numbers below 1 million using our prime_sieve() function.
# We remove all primes greater than five that contains any {0, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 8} which would make it non-prime during a rotation.
# That leaves only 1,113 prime candidates to investigate. They are added to the set primes along with 2 and 5.
