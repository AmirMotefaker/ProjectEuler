# Pandigital products
# Problem 32

# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
# for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
# containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

# 3 x 1 = 3
# 3 x 2 = 6
# 3 x 3 = 9
# 3 x 4 = 12
# 3 x 5 = 15

# 4 x 1 = 4
# 4 x 2 = 8
# 4 x 3 = 12
# ...

# In the above looping process after I had seen that the number 12 is a two digit number,
# and if I have breaked the loop there itself, then we would have saved one iteration.
# Obviously as we are using python even though you will break from one loop another loop will be working.
# If you break the loop at 12(3 x 4) then we will again start at 4 x 1 = 4 and so on. 
# Now in this we will break at 12(4 x 3) again.
