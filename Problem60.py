# Prime pair sets
# Problem 60

# The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. 
# By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime.
# For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime.
# The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

# Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.


# Solution 1

# We will generate prime numbers upto 10000(Assumed) using Sieve of Erotosthenes. 

# Take the first number from the prime numbers list, let it be a
#   then take the second number the prime numbers list, let it be b . Remember that b > a.

# Check if ab & ba are primes, if they are primes, then take the third number from the 
#   prime numbers list, let it be c. Remember that c > b.

# Check if ac, ca, bc, ca are all primes. If they are primes then take a fourth number
#    from the prime numbers list, let it be d. Remember that d > c.

# Check if ad, da, bd, db, cd, dc are all primes. If they are all primes then take the
#    fifth number from the prime numbers list, let the number be e. Remember that e > d.  

# Now check if ae, ea, be, eb, ce, ec, de, ed are all primes. If they are all primes then find a + b + c + d + e.

# Now you might have got confused on why I am checking the primality of ab, ba, ac, ca .....
